                        <p>	Research suggests that playing an instrument regularly can improve cognitive skills and increase IQ points. It's unclear whether the effects on intelligence of playing an instrument are direct or indirect-that is, is it that playing an instrument makes one more attentive and self-disciplined, and thusly better at other activities that can make you smarter, or does playing an instrument in of itself increase intelligence? I'll leave the answer to that question up to people much smarter than myself (you know, the ones that have been playing the piano since they were six years old). </p></td>

                        <p>	Does meditation make you smarter? This Zen 4MostFiver would argue that it does. We all know that meditating can help reduce stress but studies say that regular meditation can potentially change brain structure. Meditation is associated with a thickening of the portions of the brain linked to memory, attention span, decision-making, and learning. Who would've thought that a little focused R&R could actually make you smarter. It's hard to see how you can beat it, but since meditation only comes in as fourth in our list, the bar (and intelligence quotient) only goes up from here.</p></td>

                        <p>	Take it from a 4MostFive blogger who knows, blogging is a hobby that can make you brilliant. In all seriousness, the benefits of blogging go beyond getting to write about the things that fascinate and stimulate you. Blogging can help you cultivate an expertise on a given subject. This millennial pastime also makes you smarter because bloggers often teach through their blogs. When explaining a subject to a less-informed audience, teaching or explaining is an embedded part of the job, and the best way to learn anything is to teach. One popular theory for why first-born children are likely to be more intelligent than their younger siblings is because the older child develops a better understanding of things by explaining and showing the young child the ropes. Fascinating isn't it? Now go ahead and blog about it.</p></td>

                        <p>Bet you didn't expect to see this one the list. I'm sure you readers are unfamiliar with the benefits to your intelligence that can be gained through reading (this is called sarcasm...) so I'll list some of them here. Reading has been shown to reduce cognitive decline later in life, dramatically expand vocabulary, improve memory, and increase knowledge. As a bonus, reading has been shown to be a stress reducer and mood stabilizer. To some, this may all seem obvious, but the next time you are choosing between binge watching that new Netflix show and binge reading a book series that your friend recommended, just ask yourself whether you would like a side of intelligence booster with your entertainment.</p></td>

                        <p>If only there was a hobby out there that exercised both sides of the brain, increased creativity and problem-solving, could improve concentration and memory, and taught planning and foresight (or "4sight" for you 4MostFive regulars). Such a fictitious hobby would be the ideal brain-booster and would certainly top any list of hobbies that make you smarter. Unfortunately...wait a second-there actually is a hobby out there that accomplishes all of those things and more. It's called chess. The degree of strategic thought required to play the game that is estimated to have been around since the 6th century AD is enough to rigorously exercise your brain muscle, turning it into the Arnold Schwarzenegger of nervous system-controlling organs. Toss in the fact that the game is addictively fun and you have the quintessential hobby that makes you smarter.</p></td>
