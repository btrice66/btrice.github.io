                    <p>Grand Central <em>Terminal</em> (no longer Depot or Station) as we know it today was built in 1913 on the spot of a prior railroad network.  Sadly, it was allowed to deteriorate over time and in the 1960s was set to be demolished.  But thanks to public outcry, including the voice of Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis, the terminal was saved and restored to its former glory.</p>
                        <p>From the mural of the stars on the ceiling to the famous meeting place of the clocks over the information booth, there is plenty of nooks and crannies to explore in GCT.</p>

                    <p>The World Trade Center was a complex of seven buildings on a 16-acre "superblock" of Lower Manhattan.  The center, which opened in 1973, included the "Twin Towers," a pair of 110-story office buildings that were visible throughout the city</p>
                    <p>On September 11, 2001 the Twin Towers were destroyed in terrorist attacks.  Over ten years after those attacks the National September 11 Memorial opened.  Set into the footprints of those two buildings are beautiful reflecting pools surrounded by panels listing the names of all those who died on that Tuesday morning.</p>

                    <p>The Crossroads of the World, not really but it is the crossroads of 7th Avenue and Broadway, and supposedly the most visited place in the world.</p>
                    <p>Originally named Longacre Square, it was renamed "Times Square" in 1904 after the New York Times newspaper relocated its headquarters to One Times Square. The tradition of celebrating the New Year at One Times Square began soon after.</p>
                    <p>Times Square has gone through many ups and downs and today if you want a taste of the chaos and bright lights of New York City then this is the place to visit.  There is no better place to have a seat and people <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">gawk</span> watch.</p>

                    <p>Before its opening in 1883 the only way to travel between Manhattan and Brooklyn was via ferry.  Unfortunately during the winter the river sometimes froze solid making ferry travel impossible, but out of that need we have the engineering feat that is the Brooklyn Bridge.</p>
                    <p>On opening day more than 150,000 pedestrians walked across the bridge, and New Yorkers and visitors have been walking across it every since, enjoying some of the best views the city has to offer.</p>
                    <p>On the Brooklyn side of the bridge is Brooklyn Bridge Park, one of the city's newest parks.  The site of this park is where ferry service to Manhattan began in 1642 and the village of <em>Breuckelen</em> was founded.  It is also from here that future president George Washington smuggled his troops back to Manhattan after facing a fortunatly temporary defeat.</p>
                    <p>Brooklyn Bridge Park runs along the shoreline from Brooklyn Heights to DUMBO and patrons can enjoy a picnic in the park, bike riding, playgrounds, pool, "Water Lab," and many other amenities.  During the summer months you can also take in a free concert or movie.</p>

                    <h2>CENTRAL PARK</h2>
                    <img src="images/places/central_park.jpg" />

                <div class="description">
                    <p>Once a swampy, rocky terrain the two and a half miles long and half-mile wide (843 acres) parcel of land is now Manhattan's largest and most famous park.</p>
                    <p>Exploring all of Central Park's wonder could take you a day or more.  One day alone can be spent relaxing and playing games at Sheep Meadow, and yes, sheep really did graze here until the 1930s. </p>
                    <p>On your trip through Central Park take in The Mall, an elm tree lined walkway (the only intentionally straight line in the park).  At the southern end of the Mall is Literary Walk with statues of renowned authors (plus Christopher Columbus).  Or enjoy a stroll through Bethesda Terrace.  Featuring Bethesda Fountain (aka 'Angel of the Waters') and examine the many sculptures depicting the seasons and the times of day, and don't forget to check out the tiles that make up the ceiling of the terrace's arcade.</p>
                    <p>Other sites to see are Strawberry Fields, Belvedere Castle, the lake and Bow Bridge, the Alice in Wonderland and Hans Christian Andersen statues for all the book lovers, the pond and Gapstow Bridge, the Reservoir, Harlem Meer, the Conservatory Garden and many more sights to be seen.</p>
                    <p>And we won't even get started on <em>Shakespeare in the Park</em>, Summerstage or other free concerts by the Metropolitan Opera and New York Philharmonic.</p>
